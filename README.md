MTG Deckbuilder is the ending project of the course for web developer i attended. It is a deck builder for the collectible card game "Magic: The Gathering", which allows users to register on the website, create and save their own decks. Users can create a deck and select cards from various editions to add or remove from the created deck. Each user will have their own list of decks that they can potentially modify by adding or removing cards.
To start the application, you need to download the node modules by running the command 'npm i' in the frontend application folder, and then start the project on port 4200 of localhost. For the backend, you need to start the server on port 8080.
